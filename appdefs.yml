      MakeMKV is your one-click solution to convert video that you own into free and
      patents-unencumbered format that can be played everywhere. MakeMKV is a format
      converter, otherwise called "transcoder". It converts the video clips from
      proprietary (and usually encrypted) disc into a set of MKV files, preserving
      most information but not changing it in any way. The MKV format can store
      multiple video/audio tracks with all meta-information and preserve chapters.

      **NOTE**: For the container to have access to your optical drive(s), you
      need to add them to your container configuration.  This is done by adding
      a new "Device".  An optical drive is represented by two Linux device
      files: "/dev/srX" and "/dev/sgY".  For optimal performance, the container
      needs both of them.  To determine the right devices to use, start the
      container and look at its log.

      A fully automated mode is also available: insert a DVD or Blu-ray disc into an
      optical drive and let MakeMKV rips it without any user interaction.

      - title: Access to Optical Drive(s)
        level: 2
        content: |-
          By default, a Docker container doesn't have access to host's devices.  However,
          access to one or more devices can be granted with the `--device DEV` parameter.

          In the Linux world, an optical drive is represented by two different device
          files: `/dev/srX` and `/dev/sgY`, where `X` and `Y` are numbers.

          For best performance, it is recommended to expose both these devices to the
          container.  For example, for an optical drive represented by `/dev/sr0` and
          `/dev/sg1`, the following parameters would be added to the `docker run`
          command:
          ```
          --device /dev/sr0 --device /dev/sg1
          ```

          **NOTE**: For an optical drive to be detected by MakeMKV, it is mandatory to
          expose `/dev/sgY` to the container.  `/dev/srX` is optional, but performance
          could be affected.

          The easiest way to determine the right Linux devices to expose is to run the
          container (without `--device` parameter) and look at its log: during the
          startup, messages similar to these ones are outputed:
          ```
          [cont-init.d] 54-check-optical-drive.sh: executing...
          [cont-init.d] 54-check-optical-drive.sh: looking for usable optical drives...
          [cont-init.d] 54-check-optical-drive.sh: found optical drive [/dev/sr0, /dev/sg3], but it is not usable because:
          [cont-init.d] 54-check-optical-drive.sh:   --> the host device /dev/sr0 is not exposed to the container.
          [cont-init.d] 54-check-optical-drive.sh:   --> the host device /dev/sg3 is not exposed to the container.
          [cont-init.d] 54-check-optical-drive.sh: no usable optical drive found.
          [cont-init.d] 54-check-optical-drive.sh: exited 0.
          ```

          In this case, it's clearly indicated that `/dev/sr0` and `/dev/sg3` needs to be
          exposed to the container.

          **NOTE**: The container's log can be viewed by running the command
          `docker logs <container name>`.

          Alternatively, the devices can be found by executing the following command on
          the **host**:

          ```
          lsscsi -g
          ```

          From the command's output, the last two columns associated to the optical drive
          indicate the Linux devices that should be exposed to the container.  In the
          following output example, `/dev/sr0` and `/dev/sg3` would be exposed:

          ```
          [0:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      TOSHIBA DT01ACA0 A800  /dev/sda   /dev/sg0
          [1:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      ST3500418AS      HP34  /dev/sdb   /dev/sg1
          [2:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      WDC WD6401AALS-0 3B01  /dev/sdc   /dev/sg2
          [4:0:0:0]    cd/dvd  hp HLDS  DVDRW  GUD1N     LD02  /dev/sr0   /dev/sg3
          ```
      - title: Automatic Disc Ripper
        level: 2
        content: |-
          This container has an automatic disc ripper built-in.  When enabled, any DVD or
          Blu-ray video disc inserted into an optical drive is automatically ripped.  In
          other words, MakeMKV decrypts and extracts all titles (such as the main movie,
          bonus features, etc) from the disc to MKV files.

          To enable the automatic disc ripper, set the environment variable
          `AUTO_DISC_RIPPER` to `1`.

          To eject the disc from the drive when ripping is terminated, set the environment
          variable `AUTO_DISC_RIPPER_EJECT` to `1`.

          If multiple drives are available, discs can be ripped simultaneously by
          setting the environment variable `AUTO_DISC_RIPPER_PARALLEL_RIP` to `1`.

          See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for details
          about setting environment variables.

          **NOTE**: All titles, audio tracks, chapters, subtitles, etc are
                  extracted/preserved.

          **NOTE**: Titles and audio tracks are kept in their original format.  They are
                  not transcoded or converted to other formats or into smaller sizes.

          **NOTE**: Ripped Blu-ray discs can take a large amount of disc space (~40GB).

          **NOTE**: MKV Files are written to the `/output` folder of the container.

          **NOTE**: The automatic disc ripper processes all available optical drives.
      - title: Troubleshooting
        level: 2
      - title: Expired Beta Key
        level: 3
        content: |-
          If the beta key is expired, just restart the container to automatically fetch
          and install the latest one.

          **NOTE**: Once beta key expires, it can take few days before a new key is made
          available by the author of MakeMKV.  During this time, the application is not
          functional.

          **NOTE**: For this solution to work, the `MAKEMKV_KEY` environment variable must
          be set to `BETA`.  See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)
          section for more details.
